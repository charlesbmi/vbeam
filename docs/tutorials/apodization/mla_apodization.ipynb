    "\n",
    "_A brief summary of the `vbeam.core.Apodization` class is that it contains a single function `__call__`, which in Python means that we can call the object as if it was a function. Calling the `Apodization` object as a function returns the apodization weighting for a single sender, point, receiver, and transmit. This becomes more clear in the following examples._\n",
