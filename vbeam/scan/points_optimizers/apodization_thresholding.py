    """Return the indices (and indices mask which is explained further
    down) for the points in an image that are to be imaged for a given transmit. Which
    points that are selected to be imaged are determined by the given apodization object
    and threshold.

    The shape of the returned arrays is (num_transmits, num_points_per_transmit).

    If the apodization value for a given point is greater than threshold then that point
    will be imaged for the given transmit.

    ## Explanation of indices_mask:
    It is important that the size of a dimension in an array is consistent in order to
    compile it using XLA. However, the number of points to be imaged may differ between
    transmits â€” some transmits may have fewer or more points in focus than other
    transmits.

    We add extra "padding"-points to transmits that have fewer points than the maximum
    number of points for a transmit. This padding has to be removed afterwards, so we
    also return indices_mask which is 0 for points that are added as padding.

    For example, if the number of points for 3 different transmits were 4, 6, and 5,
    then padding would be added so that 6 points were imaged for each transmit. The
    indices_mask would be [1,1,1,1,0,0], [1,1,1,1,1,1], , [1,1,1,1,1,0], respectively.
    Notice how the first 4 values in the mask for the first transmit are 1s while the
    two remaining are 0s.
